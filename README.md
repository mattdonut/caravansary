# Caravansary

A place for coming together to make stuff happen!

## Things we need to do:
-------

- Come up with a project spec
- Choose some really cool technologies to try it out with
- Divy up project ownership areas
- Decide on hosting?
- Create local dev environment

## Things donut is interested in
- Using a framework that isn't Angular 1.x
- Web Components?
- Lightweight cloud hosting

## Things Jacques is interested in
- Managed hosting with addons.
- Redux, Falcor, or possibly fully-encapsulated user state if I can get more details about it worked out)
- Immutable data structures and dumb-as-bricks UI components.
- Css Modules? I personally like it better than the CSS-in-JS, but I could be convinced otherwise. Not sure how this would work with a CSS framework.
- CSS + component + test in one directory.
- CI for test + build + deploy.
- Using class-only CSS, and no programatic assembly of class names in JS to allow for a future project where we can run some build-time analysis and pune unused classes.
- Not having User accounts/login as part of the MVP unless really necesary.

## Notes and thoughts
- After reading [this](http://smashingboxes.com/blog/heroku-vs-amazon-web-services) I'm leanding towards Heroku so that we don't have to deal with setting up a server in any way. Plus, free for the first dyno is very comelling. Fortunately, it doesn't appear to lock us in too hard, so we could start there and play it by ear.)
